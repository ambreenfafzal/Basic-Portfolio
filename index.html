                        I am working as a Quality Assurance Tester and looking forward to learn coding so I can kick some butts!
                The past two weeks have been tough, I am walking aroung like a zombie, I am tired but I have also never been so excited in my entire
        life. I can't wait to walk out of this course as a Developer and become successful in my career.  </p>
                <p>When I am not testing at work, I spend time painting. I have been painting for as long as I can remember. My favorite medium is
                        Oils on Canvas or Wood Panel or Water Color on Paper. I enjoy painting Landscape and Still Life but Nature paintings are my all
                time favorite. I have been part of several Art Shows in the Chicago Area. After this class I plan to design my own website to create a 
        platform for people to view my Artwork. </p>
                <p> I love Rabbits, I think they are cute and chubby and precious little creatures. I adopted two bunnies a few years ago named Snow and Fire. 
                        One was half gray and half White,Dutch Rabbit while the other was a light brown  dwarf. In my opinion bunnies make the best pets. 
                        Snow passed away last year in August.
