        <div class="main">
                <h1>About  Me </h1>
                <p><img src="assets/images/thumbnail_IMG_4967.jpg">
                        This is where I am going to type stuff about me and my professional life as a Developer or a
                        Quality Assurance Analyst.
                        This is going to include information about my past jobs, any pets I have adopted, hobbies or any
                        other information I
                        should share with the class. </p>
                <p>This will also include details about any places I have travelled or would like to travel to, and
                        maybe I can add a few more images
                        to share with class and to also for good practice. I am definitely going to love this page in
                        the end. </p>
                <p> Just anothe paragraph to fill in the empty space in at the bottom. Also trying to see what happens
                        if this text is longer and goes all
                        the way to the bottom, will this then wrap around the text or will I have to google different
                        ways to fix this problem.
                        Then I will feel like I am going in circles, I hate that feeling, but it is what it is.
                </p>
                <p>So this is definitely my last paragraph because I am sick of typing and typing and I just finally
                        want to see what I am looking for.
                        So hopefully this line will be the last line on this page.
                </p>
